# behavioural SIR model

I studied the effects of fear on transmission dynamics of infectious diseases for my M.Sc. thesis. This repository contains the thesis (thesis.pdf) as well as all source code included in the appendices.

The source code is organized by the appendix it is found in (e.g. source code from appendix B can be found in the folder “appendixB”).
